Acknowledgments: All funding for first-line and second-line drugs for the DOTS-Plus programme was from the Latvian government. Some external technical and donor support was provided by various institutions\u2014eg, two training courses by the CDC (MDRTB clinical management course in 2000, and operations research in 2002), database management and analysis by the CDC, and a public health programme management course at the University of Arkansas. Additionally, the Nordic country governments provided technical support by helping to establish the ambulatory component of the national DOTS programme, and USAID provided support for bacteriological diagnostics and infection control. In total, about 5% of the total programme expenditures for 1998\u20132002 were provided by external donors (USAID, World Bank, Nordic country governments, and CDC). We thank Remoun Hannoush and Susan Spaethe for their expertise in constructing an intricate and useful relational database; Michael Iademarco and Kenneth Castro for their leadership and guidance; Jeanne M Courval, Steve Kammerer, Maya Sternberg, Scott A Miller, and Andy Vernon for their statistical support in the analysis of this data; Ann H Lanner for her editorial comments; and USAID for funding support to develop the information management system that facilitated this analysis.

Peterson, K. M\u00f6ll, A. Murum\u00e4gi, K. Krohn, P. Eskelin, J. Perheentupa, Y. Kadota, E. Husebye, and N. Willcox collected samples or data or did experiments for the study. K. M\u00f6ll cultured monocyte-derived DCs from the APS1 patients' and healthy donors' blood, and extracted total RNA and synthesized cDNA, which was used in the quantitative RT-PCR experiment. A. Meager, P. Peterson, K. M\u00f6ll, J. Perheentupa, and N. Willcox analyzed the data. P. Eskelin designed and performed mutational analyses and human leukocyte antigen genotyping of the APS1 patients. J. Perheentupa and E. Husebye enrolled Finnish and Norwegian APS1 patients, respectively. K. Krohn enrolled the APS1 patient whose peripheral blood monocytes were used by K. M\u00f6ll to generate DCs. J. Perheentupa and E. Husebye are the clinicians who followed all the APS1 patients involved, collected and organized all the clinical data defining each individual's course of disease, enrolled them for the study of the immune pathology of APS1, stored all the serum samples that were analyzed in this study, participated in the analysis of the immunological versus the clinical findings, and contributed to the revision of the manuscript at several stages. P. Peterson and N. Willcox collected serum samples from patients with APS2, or sporadic CMC, HP, or AD. N. Willcox also helped to collect the samples from the MG/thymoma patients mentioned in <a href=\"#pmed-0030289-t002\">Table 2</a>. A. Meager and N. Willcox played a major role in drafting the text, and P. Peterson, K. M\u00f6ll, K. Krohn, J. Perheentupa, and E.
